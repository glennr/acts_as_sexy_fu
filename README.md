# acts-as-sexy-fu

    “There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things”.
    Phil Karlton

With names like

    acts-as-taggable-on

And

    sexy_scopes

And

    attachment_fu

..one must ask: "WTF?"

Are Rails developers using all their creativity on code, and not enough on repository naming? :-)

    (533 Repos match "acts as")
    (27 Repos match "sexy")
    (184 Repos match "fu")

Well now we have one Repository To Rule Them All.

## Usage

That depends on who develops the coolest fork of this project.

## For Developers

May the best fork win!

## Credit

Someone coined the "acts-as-sexy-fu" term at one of the sessions at RailsConf '10 - I can't remember which session or who, but it was worth a LOL.
